# 👋 Hi, I'm André Aparecido!

I am a backend web developer passionate about technology and continuous learning. I am currently studying at FMU and focused on developing systems in **PHP**, with experience also in **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **SQL Server**.

My goal is to build simple, functional, and well-organized solutions — like the [InfoCar](https://github.com/DEDEJS/InfoCar) project, which I am developing as a personal vehicle maintenance system, with plans to expand it in the future.
